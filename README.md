## Etymology
The Gathas (/ˈɡɑːtəz, -tɑːz/)[1] are 17 Avestan hymns traditionally believed to have been composed by the Persian (Iranian) prophet Zarathushtra (Zoroaster).
They form the core of the Zoroastrian liturgy (the Yasna). They are arranged in five different modes or metres.

Gata with the same pronounciation of Gatha is a sweet bread from part of old Persia (now is called Armenia)
So, Tiddlywiki Gatha Plugin Maker is a sweet gata!!
